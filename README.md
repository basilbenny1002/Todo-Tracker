# Todo Tracker

A simple, locally-hosted todo tracker designed for tracking daily progress. It allows you to create projects, track time on tasks, and export your lists and progress as images. The image export feature requires an internet connection to load the necessary library, but everything else works offline.

The architecture is intentionally simple, storing all data in your browser's LocalStorage with no backend required. This means you can clone the repository and open `index.html` directly in your browser to get started.

This tool was originally created for my journal on the Study Together Discord server (https://discord.gg/study).
